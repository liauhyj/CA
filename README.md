The objective of the first part is to compare the accuracy of Logistic Regression, K-NN and Decision Tree models before and after data and feature engineering for a dataset.

## Overview of what I did for Part 1

1) Section on Decision Tree (before feature engineering)
2) Section on Feature Engineering

## Brief Description of Part 2

The objective of part 2 is to train and test the CNN tf.keras.Sequential model using a given dataset of images of fruits.

## Overview of what I did for Part 2

1) All the code written in CA_part2_jon.py, two teammates contributed to the functions run_cnn3 and run_cnn4, but I made edits to these functions for the integration into the .py file.
